# Unlimited Town Building

Build as many houses and specialized buildings as you want both in and out of new sirocco!

You must progress/have the building flag from the main quest in order to start building.

Specialized buildings will require City Hall to be built first.

Buildings placed beyond collider boundaries will be inaccessible unless you noClip or use the 'I'm stuck' button.
